In physics, vector is a number with directions, e.g., velocity. In computer science, vector is a list of numbers, here the order in the number list suggest different directions. The follow two vectors are different: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\qquad \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{array} \\right) \\end{equation} \\] In linear algebra, vectors are anything that satisfy addition and scaling, and start from same origin–the intrinsic linearity will not be chanced by addition and scaling, if the vectors keep the same origin. 3.2 \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\)spaces \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) example: The Cartesian Coordinate is Spanned by two vector. \\[ \\begin{equation} \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right)\\qquad \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\end{equation} \\] Span: The set of all of the linear combinations of the two vector. Same \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\)space can be spanned by: \\[ \\begin{equation} \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\qquad \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\end{equation} \\] But the same space can’t be spanned by \\[ \\begin{equation} \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{array} \\right)\\qquad \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{array} \\right) \\end{equation} \\] The above two vector live in a line.
